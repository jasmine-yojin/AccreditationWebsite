            <h2>About the Accreditation Team</h2>

            <p>The City University of New York is a public university and its standards for admissions to higher education must parallel those of the New York State Education Department (NYSED). 
              Accreditation is a method of quality assurance, ensuring that we do not merely accept diplomas from all high schools, including those of diploma mills. Moreover, the admissions office 
              must ensure that students we admit meet the criteria to receive Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), the state financial aid <a href ="Email Interviews/Dzelika Daniel Question.pdf">(Daniel, "RE:Question")</a>.</p>

            <p>The University Application Processing Center prepare and process applications to be sent to the admissions offices of the 24 CUNY undergraduate colleges. Rather than an applicant 
              sending separate copies of their high school transcripts to each CUNY college for individual review at each location by admissions counselors, the applicant may instead list up to 
              six different CUNY colleges in a single application which goes directly to the UAPC. The UAPC then reviews the application once and prepares the applicant files for the Decision 
              Engine, a scheduled query that categorizes applicants as Admit, Deny, Review based on admissions criteria colleges have shared with UAPC. </p>
            
            <p>Because the UAPC serves as the central processing center for the entire CUNY system where every transcript is reviewed, it is in a unique position to alert colleges to whether certain 
              schoolsâ€™ diplomas do not meet the standards for acceptance or financial aid. The completed UAPC recommendation file, which offers a suggestion of either admission, denial, or 
              waitlisting for each applicant is an essential advisory tool for CUNY college admissions and financial aid offices. Financial aid offices "rely on the data from Admissions to know 
              if the diploma meets the standard as acceptable" before distributing the state and federal grants to the students <a href ="Email Interviews/Dzelika Daniel Question.pdf">(Daniel, "RE:Question")</a>. Therefore, it is our responsibility to 
              inform other offices with a quality data and research on accreditation. </p>
            <p>
              Because of the sheer number of applications submitted to the CUNY system, a 100% completion rate for credential validation remains elusive. However, evaluating practices and 
              innovating the accreditation process allows UAPC to continue to improve and better serve both applicants and sister campuses in the college admissions process. 
              If you have any questions, please contact any or all of us.</p>
