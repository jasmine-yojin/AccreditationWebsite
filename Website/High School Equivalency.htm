          <h2>Four Pathways to a High School Equivalency Diploma</h2>
            <p>"For students first receiving aid in academic year 2006-07 and thereafter,
              the certificate of graduation must be from a recognized school providing
              secondary education within the United States; or the recognized equivalent
              of such certificate; or receiving a passing score on a federally approved
              ability benefit test that has been identified by the board of regents and
              has been independently administered and evaluated as defined by the
              commissioner" <a href="www.hesc.ny.gov/tap-coach/5-high-school-diploma.html">(HESC, "High School Diploma")</a>. Therefore, a student without a
              valid high school diploma must hold a high school equivalency diploma.
              There are four pathways to a High School Equivalency diploma in New York
              State:
            </p>

                <h3>GED</h3>
                <p>New York State selected the General Educational Development Test
                to replace the Test Assessing Secondary Completion as the primary
                pathway to a New York State High School Equivalency (HSE) Diploma,
                effective January 2022. "There are four subject tests in the GED Test
                battery: Reasoning Through Language Arts (RLA); Social Studies;
                Science; and Mathematical Reasoning. The GED RLA includes both reading
                and writing. If a test taker previously passed either the TASC Writing
                or TASC Reading subtest, but not both, they will need to take the
                RLA.The examinee must pass all the subtests to obtain the HSE diploma"
                <a href= "www.acces.nysed.gov/what-hsetasc-test">(NYSED, "What is HSE Exam?")</a>. The new RLA section will be entered under
                ENGL on CUNYFirst Test Results section. Note: Be sure to check that the applicant submits both the high school
                equivalency exam scores and the diploma. The state in which applicants
                reside at the time of testing is the state which issues the diploma. One
                cannot live in New York and take the high school equivalency exam out-ofstate
                for the exam to be valid <a href="Email Interviews/Angela Mingley NYS TASC.pdf">(Midgley, “NYS TASC”)</a>. In fact, that state
                will not issue a diploma to a non-resident. If a NYS resident has scores from another state and did not
                earn a diploma, those scores should be imported to New York and obtain the
                New York State diploma <a href="Email Interviews/Angela Mingley NYS TASC.pdf">(Midgley, “NYS TASC”)</a>. Visit NYSED's section on
                "Ready, Set, Test" for more information on transferring the scores. If
                applicants took an online GED or HiSet exams, those scores are not accepted
                by New York State. To ensure that there is a valid NYS HSE diploma, use the
                Status Report. If there is a diploma outcome on this page, then it is an
                official NYS high school equivalency diploma. If the Status Report comes
                back as no record, the candidate should call the HSE Call Center to
                discover the problem.</p>

                <h3>24+ College Credits</h3> 
                  <p>Applicants may seek to obtain a New York State
                  High School Equivalency (HSE) diploma based on their having earned 24
                  college credits (or the equivalent) in a degree or a certificate
                  granting program at a college located within the United States or
                  accredited by a United States institution of higher education.
                  Applicants must currently reside in New York State (for a minimum of 30
                  days) and may not have graduated from high school nor already have
                  qualified for a NYS HSE diploma</p>

                <h3>National External Diploma Program</h3><p>The NEDP is a flexible, selfdirected
                  web-based program, overseen by approved agencies, where
                  participants demonstrate mastery of required skills via a series of
                  performance tasks completed online at home and through in-office visits
                  and competency progress reports. Participants receive guidance and
                  support from certified NEDP academic advisors.</p>

                <h3>GED + Regents</h3> <p>A student can replace up to/maximum of 4 subtests with
                  the passing regents scores. They must sit for the exam for a passing
                  score (500+) on at least one of the five subtests. This option to
                  obtain a NYS diploma has been available since 2018. Since the pandemic,
                  more of these students have been using this route.</p>

            <h3>HiSET</h3> 
              <p> Offered in several states, the <a href = "https://hiset.ets.org/">HiSET</a> has five subtests:
              Language Arts Reading, Language Arts Writing (short answers and essay),
              Mathematics, Science and Social Studies. Subtest scores range from 1-
              20. Passing requires a minimum of 8 on each subtest plus a total
              minimum of 45. The essay requires a score of 2 (6 being the maximum) to
              pass. At this time, we have not come across this kind of document yet.
              If you find one, please bring it to the Accreditation team’s attention.
             </p>
            

            <h3>The California High School Proficiency Examination</h3>
              <p><a href = "https://www.chspe.org/">CHSPE</a> is a testing program taken voluntarily to assess basic skills in mathematics, 
              reading and writing. Passing this 2-section exam gives the test taker the option to leave school early with their parent’s permission. 
              The exam has two sections that must be passed in order to receive a Certificate of Proficiency issued by the California State Board of Education. 
              This is considered equivalent to a high school diploma. This document is usually a certificate accompanied by a score report. Below is what it looks like:
              </p>

                  <img src="Examples/CHSPE Score report.PNG" alt="CHSPE score report" class="center"> 

            <h3>GED</h3>
                <p>Many states continue to offer the <a href= "https://ged.com/">GED</a> examinations. The exam consists of four subtests: Reasoning Through Language Arts, Mathematical Reasoning, Science and Social Studies. 
                Subtest scores range from 100-200, with 150 the minimum passing score. A total of 600 is required to pass and obtain the GED diploma. International applicants can obtain this by 
                taking the test at a GED international location in their home country. These GEDs are issued to them by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education in Washington, DC. 
                Below is an example of what this GED should look like: 
                </p>

          <h2>Ability to Benefit Test</h2>
            <p>To meet the high school requirement for TAP eligibility, a student who does not have a U.S high school diploma or the recognized equivalent may receive NYS aid, 
                provided the student has received a passing score on a federally approved ATB test identified by the NYS Board of Regents. As of July 2015, the Regents approved four 
                ability-to-benefit tests to be used to determine eligibility for State financial aid: </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Accuplacer </li>
          
                  <li>Wonderlic Basic Skills Test </li>
          
                  <li>Spanish Wonderlic Basic Skills Test </li>
          
                  <li>CELSA (Combined English Language Skills Assessment). The CELSA is approved providing the applicant also takes a math component from one of the other approved tests. </li>
              </ul>
            <p>    
              A student must pass an ATB test if they have an individualized Education Diploma (IEP) may pass the ATB test to receive state financial aid as IEP diplomas are not equivalent to a local 
                or Regents diploma. Home-schooled students who are not able to obtain a Superintendent letter from the district of their residence may also take ATB test.  
                For more questions regarding ATB, go to <a href="https://www.hesc.ny.gov/partner-access/financial-aid-professionals/grants-and-scholarships-questions-and-answers/grants-and-scholarships-ability-to-benefit-questions-and-answers.html">HESC’s Q&A</a> on ATB. 
            </p>
          


          <h2>Job Corps + Online High School</h2>  
            <p>Several Job Corps Centers, including Delaware Valley and Iroquois, have arranged with their local high school superintendent to offer a high school program that combines work from 
               Penn Foster High School (online), on-site teaching, and other elements of instruction. Students who complete this program are issued a letter from the superintendent stating that 
               they have completed a program equivalent to a NYS high school program. If a student presents such a letter, we will admit them based upon the superintendent’s statement. We are not 
               admitting them based upon a Penn Foster or other virtual school diplomas but rather on the superintendent’s letter. The superintendent’s letter is like the letter issued to 
               home-schooled students. Job Corps is NOT allowed to issue such letter or diploma. We do not take a generic letter from the superintendent’s office that approves a Job Corps program. 
               The superintendent’s letter must state the student’s name. We should request the Job Corp students to obtain student-specific letters from the superintendent's office. 
               Pay close attention to the date of the verification letter and match that against the student’s year of graduation.
