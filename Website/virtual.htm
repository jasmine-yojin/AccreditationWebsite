            <h2>NYSED's Stance on Virtual Diplomas</h2>
            <p>High school completion is under the jurisdiction of the state in which the
              student was a resident. NYS does not recognize on-line or correspondence
              study as the equivalent to a high school diploma for New York State
              residents <a href="Email Interviews/Leslie Templeman Virtual & Distance Education Diploma.pdf">(Templeman, “Virtual & Distance Education Diploma.”)</a>. Also, to be
              eligible for TAP, the NYS resident student would have to have a high school
              equivalency diploma or pass an ability to benefit test <a href="Email Interviews/Dzelika Daniel Question.pdf">(Daniel,
              “Question”)</a>. Please refer to the High School Equivalency section. This
              policy is established by the fact that the Board of Regents has not
              identified any online or correspondence programs as being equivalent.
              <a href="https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Document/I3652de20c22211ddb29d8bee567fca9f?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default) ">Section 100.7 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Educations</a> outlines
              the requirements for a high school equivalency diploma <a href="Email Interviews/Leslie Templeman Virtual & Distance Education Diploma.pdf">(Templeman,
              “Virtual & Distance Education Diploma.”)</a>. Diplomas outlined here are the
              only recognized equivalent of a high school diploma. There is no mention of
              on-line or correspondence diplomas in that regulation.
            </p>
            <h2>Public Online Schools are Acceptable</h2>
            <p>We accept diplomas from public online schools run and operated by the
              public districts of that state. These diplomas are substantially
              equivalent. Free tuition is a common trait of public online schools.</p>
            
            <h2>Processing Online Diplomas</h2>
            <p>At this time, UAPC continues to reject diplomas from online high schools
              earned by a student who was a resident of a state that does recognize the
              online diploma. High school equivalency diploma or an ability-to-benefit test is
              required to receive TAP. </p>  
            
            <p>Parents of homeschool applicants are allowed to create their own curriculum
                or select a curriculum from online course publishers. If the applicant
                reports that they are homeschooled or they are later determined that they
                are homeschool applicants who have used an online curriculum, please refer
                to the rules of the homeschool verification.</p>
            <h2>Residencey Matters</h2>  
            <p>At times, foreign applicants living in another country complete American
              online curriculum and provide state-issued diplomas. Again, high school
              completion is under the jurisdiction of the state in which the student
              is/was a resident. Even if the diploma is acceptable in certain US states,
              we cannot accept it because the applicant is not the resident of that
              state. In this case, the applicant can try obtaining a diploma from the
              ministry of education of the applicant’s country of residence by
              transferring the credits from the online school.</p>
