          <h2>NYS Diploma/State-Issued Diploma: Regents & Local</h2>
            <p>CUNY will only accept diplomas from NY resident applicants who have
              graduated from NY state high schools. NYS diplomas are Regents and local
              Diplomas and they are also called the "Sate-Issued" diplomas <a href= "Email Interviews/Melissa Montague Questions about NYS Diplomas.pdf">(Montague,
              "Re: Questions about NYS Diplomas")</a>. “Earning a Regents or local high
              school diploma shall be deemed to be equivalent to receipt of a high school
              diploma pursuant to Education Law, section 3202(1)” <a href="www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/1005-diploma-requirements">(NYSED, “100.5 Diploma
              Requirements”)</a>. The New York State Higher Education Services Corporation, a
              financial aid organization, recognizes Regents and local diplomas as the
              equivalent of high school diploma <a href="www.hesc.ny.gov/tap-coach/5-high-school-diploma.html">(HESC, “High School Diploma”)</a>. A Tuition
              Assistance Program (TAP) cannot be issued to those without these diplomas
              or the equivalent <a href="www.hesc.ny.gov/tap-coach/5-high-school-diploma.html">(HESC, “High School Diploma”)</a>.<br><br>

              Both diploma types require students to earn 22 units of credits by taking
              certain number of English, Social Studies, Science, Mathematics, and
              Foreign Language courses. Regents diploma requires passing four exams in
              each of the four subject areas (English, Mathematics, Science, Social
              Studies) plus one pathway. Local diplomas can be earned via appeals, safety
              nets, or superintendent determination if students are not able to earn a
              passing score of 65 on Regents exams. Once the Regents or local diploma is
              awarded, the student is no longer eligible for free public high school
              education <a href="www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/1005-diploma-requirements">(NYSED, “100.5 Diploma
                Requirements”)</a>. Keep in mind, for nonpublic
              schools, only the registered high schools can issue Regents or local
              diplomas <a href= "Email Interviews/Melissa Montague Questions about NYS Diplomas.pdf">Re: Questions about NYS Diplomas")</a>.

          <h2>Career Development and Occupational Studies (CDOS) Commencement Credential
            Achievement Commencement Credential IEP Diploma</h2>
          <p>The CUNY system does NOT accept Career Development and Occupational Studies
            (CDOS) Commencement Credential and Achievement Commencement Credential as
            the equivalent of high school diploma. CDOS has replaced what was called
            the Individualized Education Program, or IEP, diploma <a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/SACCmemo.htm">(NYSED, “Skills and
            Achievement Commencement Credential with Severe Disabilities”)</a>. These
            credentials may be attached to the Regents and local diplomas but they
            themselves cannot serve as the high school diploma. CDOS credentials enable
            students to exit high school without being considered either graduates or
            dropouts. They may go back to high school (or remain eligible for free
            public education) until receiving a Regents or local diploma.<br><br>
            CDOS credentials are mainly earned by students with learning disabilities
            and were unable to meet all academic and Regent’s requirements for a
            diploma. These students must demonstrate career development, learning, and
            universal foundation skills to be able to receive this credential before
            leaving the school. The NYS Education Department wants to ensure that CDOS
            credentials still verify skills required to obtain a job even without a
            high school diploma. “The certificate awarded looks similar in form to the
            diploma issued by the school district or nonpublic school, except that it
            must not use the term “diploma” but must indicate that the student has
            earned a New York State Career Development and Occupational Studies
            Commencement Credential that has been endorsed by the New York State Board
            of Regents as a certificate of readiness for entry-level employment. Award
            of the credential must be documented in the student’s transcript” <a href="www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/CDOScredential-613.pdf">(NYSED,
            “Special Education Field Advisory”)</a>. On CUNYFirst, the diploma field would
            show “ZZZZZ” with status as “No Degree” from data source NY Department of
            Education from the DOE load. The DOE load and the transcript would not
            specifically indicate IEP.</p>

          <h2>Nonpublic Schools in NY</h2>
          <p>Substantial Equivalence: “The compulsory attendance law in New York State
            requires that all children between the ages of six and sixteen be provided
            with a program of instruction, either at a public school or elsewhere. The
            object of the compulsory attendance law is to see that children are not
            left in ignorance, that from some source they receive the instruction that
            will fit them for their place in society. If a child attends a nonpublic
            school or is being educated at home, the board of education of each school
            district must be assured that the child is receiving instruction which is
            substantially equivalent to that provided in the public schools of the
            district of residence. The Board’s responsibility is the children living in
            the district; it has no direct authority over a nonpublic school. The board
            usually asks its superintendent of schools to gather the information
            necessary for determining substantial equivalence” <a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/nonpub/manualfornewadministratorsofnps/statereqs">(NYSED, “State
            Requirements and Programs”)</a>.<br><br>
            NYSED registration is equivalent to accreditation. If a school is not
            registered, it is not accredited. If the school is located in NY, it must
            be listed on NYSED database. There are NO EXCEPTIONS. It is not acceptable
            if a school in NY has regional accreditation but not NYSED registration.<br><br>
            Private high schools are not required to obtain registration. However, the
            State Office of Religious and Independent Schools (SORIS) highly recommends
            that private high schools obtain registration status <a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/nonpub/applicationnpssecschreg/">(NYSED, “Nonpublic
            High school Registration”)</a>. Only a registered secondary school may
            administer Regents examinations and award diplomas <a href= "Email Interviews/Melissa Montague Questions about NYS Diplomas.pdf">(Montague, "Re:
            Questions about NYS Diplomas")</a>. Nonpublic nonregistered high schools issue
            a certificate of completion stating the graduates completed their local
            diploma requirements <a href= "Email Interviews/Melissa Montague Questions about NYS Diplomas.pdf">(Montague, "Re:
              Questions about NYS Diplomas")</a>. Any
            high school diplomas issued by nonregistered high schools are not
            acceptable. If you notice one, it must be reported to SORIS.
            
            All educational organizations undergo NYSED registration before they can
            begin operations. Thus, NYSED has records of all educational organizations
            in their database. To check for any NYS high school’s
            registration/accreditation, go to the <a href ="https://portal.nysed.gov/pls/sedrefpublic/SED.sed_inst_qry_vw$.startup">NYSED school directory</a>.
            
            Search using this format: “%name of the school%”. Make sure to double check
            the names, spelling, etc. when conducting the search. Listed below are the
            categories of nonpublic high schools and their definitions:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li> <b>REGISTERED:</b> The school’s education is substantially equivalent. Can
                issue their own valid New York State Regents or local diplomas and
                their students can take the regents. Students can qualify for
                government programs such as grants and transportation costs. </li>
              <li> <b>APPROVED:</b> The school’s curriculum coincides with the NYS curriculum
                standards, but they cannot issue diplomas on their own.</li>
              <li> <b>RECOGNIZED:</b> The school’s curriculum may or may not coincide with NYS
                curriculum. High Schools cannot issue their own diplomas.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            The BEDS ("Basic Education Data System") Number on the database is an
            identification number for NYS to keep track of non-public schools. To check
            the registration status of a religious or pending registration school, or
            if you want to clarify any anomalies on the NYSED database, email SORIS at
            soris@nysed.gov or call 518-473-8202.

          <h2>Special Education Schools in NY</h2>
          <p>Approved NYS Special Education Schools: These <a href= "http://www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/privateschools/home.html">private schools</a> are approved
            by the state to provide special education (IEP). 
            Special education schools that are not approved do not issue diplomas to
            students who are graduating, but instead sends a transcript of completed
            course work to the student’s Committee on Special Education (CSE) in the
            school district where the student resides <a href="Email Interviews/Christine Yalanis Hawthorn Country Day School Diploma.pdf">(RE: Hawthorn Country
            Day School Diploma")</a>. The school district then issues the diploma. These
            schools are not necessarily registered but we accept them if a student
            completes the equivalent of the Regents or local diploma. The students who
            receive Regents diploma also take and pass the required Regents exams. We
            accept these cases and use the External OrgID of the special education
            school to process the applications. The verification of the diploma should
            be checked by the colleges once the student is admitted and make sure that
            the diploma is not IEP. IEP students may receive Career Development
            Occupational Studies described above. We do not accept this. Be sure to
            verify.</p>
