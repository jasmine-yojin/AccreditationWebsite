          <h2>Substantial Equivalence</h2>
            <p>In order to meet state's comulsory education requirements, students and <a href="http://www.nysed.gov/nonpublic-schools/information-students-wishing-attendcollege">parents must show</a> that the home school education program is equivalent to public high school education. This is called the <b>substantial equivalence</b>.
             In order to receive the letter of substantial equivalence, the student must register with the state <i>from the point</i> they start the home school. That means unregistered students who have received education in non-accredited schools or online schools need to sit for GED/HSE. Therefore, you should not direct every homeschool student to receive a letter from the district because the situatuions may be different.
             Please note that the letter must come from public school district.
            </p>

          <h2>Residency Matters</h2>
          <p>If a student indicated that they were "homeschooled" on their application and was homeschooled virtually, we will only accept based on the state of their residency. i.e., the student was virutally homeschooled in California and the student lives in NYC. If the student provides a superintendent letter from NYS, we will accept it.</p>

              <h2>New York State</h2>
              <p>If not graduated yet, the homeschooled students will need to send two letters from the superintendent: one during senior year and the final one that states that they graduated/met requirements for graduation. If graduated, only the final letter is required. The NYS superintendent letter will not straightforwardly say that the home school program is equivalent to public school education, however, it is a letter of substantial equivalence. Acceptable home school letter <a href="#NYC">examples </a>are provided below.</p>

            <div class="column">
              <h2>Out-Of-State</h2>
              <p>Not every state issues home school verification letter to home school students. Out-of-state home school verification letters from the state's district are similar to that of New York. Be sure to look for the language of substantial equivalence in the letter. If the letter from the state is present, that letter serves as the diploma. Some states issue actual state diploma for home schooled students. 
                 If the student cannot provide a letter or a state-issued diploma, they must sit for the GED or High School Equivalency Exam.
