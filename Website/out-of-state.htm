          <h2>Background: Regional Accreditation</h2>
            <p>Accreditation is a quality assurance mechanism that certifies that schools
              meet specific operational, programmatic, and selected performance
              standards. It is based on a voluntary self-evaluation process <a href="https://www.taicep.org/taiceporgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Changing-Landscape-of-Accreditation-Guide-to-Secondary-School-Recognition-in-the-United-States.pdf">(Bellin and
              Wenger 2)</a>. Accreditation was created as an efficient means for admissions
              offices of higher education to assess quality of secondary education and
              its eligibility for higher education. Its origin dates to 1870s when
              University of Michigan made on-site assessment visits of high school
              seniors using a battery of tests <a href="https://www.taicep.org/taiceporgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Changing-Landscape-of-Accreditation-Guide-to-Secondary-School-Recognition-in-the-United-States.pdf">(Bellin and
                Wenger 3)</a>. Although the
              process was lengthy and time-consuming, applicants could simply provide a
              valid high school diploma once their high school has undergone the
              “accreditation through inspection,” increasing the efficiency of
              admissions. Between 1895 and 1917, American colleges and secondary schools
              came together in five (later six) regional associations...sought a
              voluntary method for identifying intuitions capable of meeting their
              objectives <a href="https://www.taicep.org/taiceporgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Changing-Landscape-of-Accreditation-Guide-to-Secondary-School-Recognition-in-the-United-States.pdf">(Bellin and
                Wenger 3)</a>. Among the six associations include
              Middles States Association in 1887 and North Central Association of
              Colleges and Schools in 1895. For the next six decades, the highest US
              standard for public and private secondary schools was regional
              accreditation <a href="https://www.taicep.org/taiceporgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Changing-Landscape-of-Accreditation-Guide-to-Secondary-School-Recognition-in-the-United-States.pdf">(Bellin and
                Wenger 4)</a>.<br><br>
              The number of secondary institutions seeking accreditation increased until
              the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (2002) and the Every Student
              Succeeds Act (2015). No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation stated that
              all students must perform at a proficient level, according to each state’s
              criteria <a href="https://www.taicep.org/taiceporgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Changing-Landscape-of-Accreditation-Guide-to-Secondary-School-Recognition-in-the-United-States.pdf">(Bellin and
                Wenger 4)</a>. It encouraged stronger accountably, proven methods, and more freedom for
              states. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015 further extended the
              NCLA and further reduced oversight from the federal government in favor of
              greater autonomy to the states <a href="https://www.taicep.org/taiceporgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Changing-Landscape-of-Accreditation-Guide-to-Secondary-School-Recognition-in-the-United-States.pdf">(Bellin and
                Wenger 4)</a>. ESSA legislation
              focused on accountability and less on accreditation. Unlike postsecondary
              institutions, the US Department of Education does not require secondary
              institutions to participate in federal student-aid programs <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/k-12-accreditations-next-move-storied-guarantee-looks-to-accountability-2-0/">(Oldham)</a>.
              Therefore, most colleges have regional accreditation while many high
              schools do not. Often, states orchestrate funding for high schools. More
              focus on state accountability and less on regional accreditation led to a
              fewer number of secondary schools seeking accreditation.<br><br>Nevertheless, “accreditation is often the most desired quality in a school
              and the clearest indication of quality assurance” <a href="https://www.taicep.org/taiceporgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Changing-Landscape-of-Accreditation-Guide-to-Secondary-School-Recognition-in-the-United-States.pdf">(Bellin and
                Wenger 6)</a>. “A
              recent survey by the Western Association found 97.9 percent of the 710
              California high-school principals who responded agreed the accreditation
              process had positive effects on student learning” <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/k-12-accreditations-next-move-storied-guarantee-looks-to-accountability-2-0/">(Oldham)</a>. CUNY, as well
              as several other public universities such as University of California,
              California State University systems, and Arizona State University require a
              high school diploma from a regionally accredited high school for admission
              <a href="https://www.taicep.org/taiceporgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Changing-Landscape-of-Accreditation-Guide-to-Secondary-School-Recognition-in-the-United-States.pdf">(Bellin and
                Wenger 5)</a> <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/k-12-accreditations-next-move-storied-guarantee-looks-to-accountability-2-0/">(Oldham)</a>. Today, there are four major accrediting
              agencies: AdvancED, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools
              Commissions on Elementary and Secondary Schools, the Western Association of
              Schools and Colleges, and the New England Association of Schools and
              Colleges <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/k-12-accreditations-next-move-storied-guarantee-looks-to-accountability-2-0/">(Oldham)</a>.</p>

          <h2>Checking Accreditation for Out-Of-State Nonpublic Schools</h2>
          <p>High School completion is under the jurisdiction of the state in which the
            student was a resident. Because of the NCLB and ESSA laws, some states
            assume more control over the quality assurance of the private schools.
            Check with the state’s website and contact. <a href="Examples/FederalGuideline4nonpublic.pdf">Federal Guideline for Nonpublic
            Schools</a> gives general insight on how each of the 50 states handle
            accreditation of nonpublic schools.</p>

            <p>Each state has their own term to describe substantial equivalence.
              Approval, recognition, registration are some of the examples. Be sure that
              the school in question is classified under the category of substantial
              equivalence, not merely a license to operate. At times, states leave the
              work of accreditation to the accrediting body their Board of Education
              approves. For example, the Connecticut Department of Education clearly
              lists nonregional accrediting bodies on their website: AACS, ACSI, and
              CAIS. If a school is accredited by the accrediting body that the state
              approves, we will accept that school. Some states have little oversight on
              religious private schools. As a rule, if the states do not do their own
              accreditation, we will accept schools with regional accreditation. The
              regional accrediting bodies are as follows:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://home.cognia.org/registry">Cognia/AdvancEd</a> now represents North Central Association Commission,
                  Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and Northwest
                  Accreditation Commission.</li>  
                <li><a href="https://www.msa-cess.org/membership-directory/?typ=main">Middle States Commission on Secondary Schools (MSA)</a></li>   
                <li><a href="https://www.neasc.org/neasc-directory">New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC)</a></li> 
                <li><a href="https://directory.acswasc.org/new/">Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC)</a></li>   
              </ul>

              <p>At this time, we do not accept high schools with regional accreditation if
                  they are online/virtual/correspondence/distance learning.</p>


          <h2>International American-Patterned Schools</h2>
          <p>International Schools are schools that are not part of the education system
            of the country in which they are located in. International schools follow
            the foreign curriculum rather than the national or locally designed
            curriculum. American-Patterned Schools are international schools located
            outside of USA accredited by US regional accrediting bodies listed above.
            Their curriculum mirrors that of those in America. These schools often cite
            regional accreditation on their website. The accreditation should be
            verified directly by checking the directory of the regional accrediting
            body’s website. NEASC has a separate <a href="https://cie.neasc.org/cie-school-directory">directory</a> for international schools.</p>

            <p>If the school located in a foreign country does not have any US regional
              accreditation, the International Department shall handle the accreditation
              and verify whether the school has accreditation from the ministry of the
              education of the country. Note that all United Nations schools are
              considered foreign schools and need to be evaluated by the International
              Department. On CUNYFirst, the evaluation is entered under the specific
              OrgID of the school and not under the generic Non-English OrgID of the
              country the school is located in. If the generic OrgID is present, it
              should be removed. The English credits should be entered under ENGL, not
              LANG & FL English. The ESL indicator should be released if present.</p>

            <p>International Baccalaureate schools are a type of international school.
              International Baccalaureate organization (IB) provider work with the
              partner schools, provide the curriculum, and supplies assessment resources.
              There are now 942 American high schools offering the IB Diploma Program. IB
              World Schools operate in over 150 countries and the diploma program is
              offered in over 500 schools. The IB Diploma is accepted globally for
              university admissions <a href="https://www.taicep.org/taiceporgwp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Changing-Landscape-of-Accreditation-Guide-to-Secondary-School-Recognition-in-the-United-States.pdf">(Bellin & Wenger 2020)</a>. The IB examination scores should be entered in Test Scores
              section. The evaluation of the high school transcript should be completed
              under External OrgID 23760309.</p>

              <h2>DOD Department of Defense Unified District</h2>
              <p>Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) is a federal organization
                that provides education to children of military families around the globe.
                DoDEA's schools are divided into 3 areas: Europe, Pacific, and the
                Americas. All DoDEA schools are accredited by the North Central Association
                Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA CASI) or the
                Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and
                School Improvement (SACS CASI). Their 160 accredited schools include DoDEA
                Virtual School. We accept all high schools from DoDEA.</p>

                <h2>Puerto Rico</h2>
                <p>Domestic Department evaluates high school transcripts from Puerto Rico. We
                  take all public high schools. Use this <a href="http://de.gobierno.pr/padres-y-estudiantes/conoce-tu-escuela/">link</a> to verify whether a high school
                  is public.Puerto Rico’s state education department does not accredit private schools.
                  See if the school has a regional accreditation. MSA and Cognia are popular
                  accreditation among the private schools in Puerto Rico. Every school
                  receives license to operate from the Educational Council of Puerto Rico.
                  This license is not equivalent to accreditation. If the school is private,
                  use this <a href = "http://jip.estado.pr.gov/basica/bootstrapdtweb.asp">link</a> to check whether a school is accredited. Note the following words
                  under the Accreditation Column:<br><br>
                  (Under Accreditation Column) <b>Vigente</b> - Active until date noted. We take.<br>
                  (Under Accreditation Column) <b>Vencida</b> - Expired. We do not take.<br><br>
                  Church-exempt schools are exempt from state license/registration. UAPC
                  usually does not take church-exempt schools unless accredited by Middle
                  States or listed on the Council of Puerto Rico website.</p>
